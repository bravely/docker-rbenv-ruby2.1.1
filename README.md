docker-rbenv-ruby2.1.1
======================

Docker image with an rbenv-installed 2.1.1 version of Ruby. This is not meant to be run by itself; Instead, use this to prepare other images/builds.

Created with a bit of guidance from [tcnksm/docker-rbenv](https://github.com/tcnksm/docker-rbenv).

Usage
-----

`docker pull quaunaut/rbenv-ruby2.1.1`
